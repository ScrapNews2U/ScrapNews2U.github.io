Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, accuses Donald Trump of contributing to the increase in antisemitism and Islamophobia in the country. Christie claims that Trump's intolerant rhetoric gives permission for others to express their hatred. He also highlights that this intolerance is not limited to Trump but exists in some elite institutions as well. Despite Trump's support for Israel, antisemitic incidents surged during his presidency. Christie positions himself as a challenger to Trump in the 2024 GOP race, alongside Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley. |

Former President Donald Trump made an appearance at the Clemson-South Carolina football game in a bid to upstage his Republican opponent, Nikki Haley, on her home turf. Trump, who is the front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination, received chants of support from fans in attendance. Haley, a Clemson alumna and former South Carolina governor, did not attend the game. Trump was a guest of Governor Henry McMaster, Haley's successor, and was accompanied by Senator Lindsey Graham. Trump's visit was preceded by his campaign announcement that he had been endorsed by more South Carolina legislators than all opposing candidates combined. This visit to South Carolina is seen as a strategic move as the state's primary, a key early voting state, approaches. The article also mentions Trump's previous sports cameos and his history with Haley in the state. |

BBC's International Editor Jeremy Bowen admits to misreporting a bombing on a hospital in Gaza, but doesn't express remorse. The misreporting occurred during the conflict between Israel and Hamas, where Bowen suggested that Al-Ahli hospital was 'flattened' in an explosion. The British government later confirmed that the hospital was intact and the explosion had occurred in the car park. Bowen defends his reporting, stating that he drew conclusions from the pictures he saw at the time. Critics argue that the BBC's journalism during the conflict has been of poor quality. |

The Adult Survivors Act, which temporarily lifted the statute of limitations on civil abuse and harassment claims, expired this week in New York. As a result, several high-profile sexual assault lawsuits have been filed, including ones against New York Mayor Eric Adams, music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, and rock legend Axl Rose. If the claims proceed, these individuals could face jury trials. The Adult Survivors Act was passed in 2022 and allowed survivors of sexual offenses that occurred when they were over the age of 18 to sue regardless of the statute of limitations. |
