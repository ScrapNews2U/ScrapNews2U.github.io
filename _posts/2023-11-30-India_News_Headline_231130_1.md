The exit poll results for the Telangana Assembly elections will be released today evening.

In the previous elections, KCR's party Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS) secured 88 out of the total 119 seats. However, both the BJP and INC have expanded their campaigns in Telangana this year in an attempt to challenge BRS's dominance. The results of the assembly elections will be declared on December 3, 2023. |
