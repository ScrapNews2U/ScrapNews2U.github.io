At least 12 rat-hole mining specialists have begun manual drilling to rescue 41 workers who are trapped in the collapsed Silkyara tunnel in Uttarakhand's Uttarkashi. The drilling approach was adopted after a large auger machine became stuck. Vertical drilling has reached a depth of 36 meters out of the required 86 meters. The rescuers aim to extract the workers by Thursday through a one-meter-wide shaft. A secondary probe has also indicated no significant geological obstacles. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged people to pray for the safe release of the trapped individuals. |

A six-member rat-hole mining team has been deployed to rescue 41 workers who have been trapped inside the Silkyara tunnel in Uttarkashi for 16 days. The rescue operation involves manual drilling and excavation using the rat-hole mining method. Parts of a US-made auger machine got stuck in the rubble, prompting officials to employ alternative options such as vertical drilling and the rat-hole mining technique. The team of rat-hole miners from Madhya Pradesh will manually drill through the remaining debris and evacuate the workers. Rat-hole mining is a primitive method involving narrow, horizontal passages. The rescue process is expected to take around 24-32 hours. However, bad weather conditions may hinder the operation. |
