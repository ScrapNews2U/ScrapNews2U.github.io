Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that the war against Hamas will continue even after the ceasefire. The Israeli Cabinet was expected to vote on a plan that would temporarily halt Israel's offensive in Gaza in exchange for the release of some hostages held by Hamas. Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until all of Israel's goals are achieved. The announcement came as Israeli troops battled Palestinian militants in Gaza, and details of the ceasefire deal were not released. The toll in Gaza has risen sharply, with thousands killed and many missing or buried under rubble. Talks between Israel, the US, and Qatar over a hostage release and aid have been ongoing. The fighting has shifted to the Jabaliya refugee camp, affecting nearby hospitals, and conditions in Gaza remain dire. |
