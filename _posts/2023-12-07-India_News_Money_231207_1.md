The Madras High Court has provided a ruling on the initiation of prosecution under Section 276CC of the Income Tax Act for failure to file a return of income. The court held that genuine taxpayers who file returns belatedly or have paid substantial amounts of their tax dues are protected by the proviso of Section 276CC. In the specific case, the taxpayer had paid taxes amounting to Rs. 23,75,066, exceeding the total tax and interest payable of Rs. 23,74,610, thus being rescued from prosecution. It is advised to assess each case individually to determine the applicability of the prosecution provision. |
