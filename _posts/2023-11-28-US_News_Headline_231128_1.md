More than 300,000 students have been accepted into colleges even before completing their application through the Common App's direct admission program. The program examines incomplete applications and gives out acceptances to students based on GPA, test requirements, living in poverty-stricken areas, or having parents who have not gone to college. This initiative coincides with the recovery of undergraduate enrollment rates, particularly among Black, Hispanic, and Asian students. Direct admission programs are growing in popularity as they benefit both colleges and students by simplifying the admissions process. |
