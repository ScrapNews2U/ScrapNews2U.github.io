The US has issued a nationwide alert due to a deadly listeria outbreak linked to a popular grocery store snack. The outbreak has been linked to peaches, plums, or nectarines from HMC farms. One person has died and 10 others have been hospitalized after consuming fruit products from the company. The CDC advises anyone who bought these products between May 1 and November 15, 2022 and 2023 to throw them out immediately. The products are sold under the brands HMC Farms or Signature Farms. The outbreak has been reported in California, Colorado, Kansas, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and Florida, and the number of those infected is expected to increase. Listeria can survive in the refrigerator and can spread to other foods and surfaces, making it particularly dangerous. Pregnant women, newborns, and immuno-compromised individuals are at high risk.
