The world's largest iceberg, named A23a, is on the move after being stranded for over three decades off West Antarctica. Weighing nearly a trillion metric tonnes and measuring almost 4,000 square km, the colossal iceberg is now drifting quickly past the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Scientists believe that strong winds and currents are aiding its movement. There is a possibility that A23a could become grounded at South Georgia island, which would pose a problem for the wildlife there. Additionally, the iceberg could disrupt shipping if it makes its way farther north toward South Africa. |

A Russian man weighing over 616lbs died of a heart attack after being bedridden for five years. Despite his efforts to lose weight by eating less and avoiding flour products, it was too late to reverse the damage caused by his obesity. Doctors had warned him to lose at least seven stone to have a chance at a normal life. This story is similar to that of Lupe Samano, a US woman who was bed bound for 12 years due to her food addiction but managed to turn her life around through diet, exercise, and gastric bypass surgery. |

According to royal author Omid Scobie, Prince William believes that Prince Harry has been "brainwashed" by therapists and can no longer recognize his own brother. Their relationship worsened after Harry's explosive interview in 2021, where he aired his grievances with the royal family. Harry's subsequent documentary and memoir did not help mend the rift. Prince William felt betrayed by Harry and Meghan's actions and expressed his disdain for their perceived self-importance. Meanwhile, Harry felt like a backup and supporting role to William, leading to strained relationships with his brother and father. |

The Israeli military warns of complications in implementing the hostage release deal with Hamas, stating that "nothing is over until it's over." Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari expresses relief over the release of 24 hostages but emphasizes the need for preparation and caution as the situation unfolds. The four-day ceasefire brokered by Qatar marks a pause in the Israel-Hamas war, enabling the release of hostages from Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterates the commitment to the safe return of all hostages, as it remains a key objective of the ongoing conflict. |
