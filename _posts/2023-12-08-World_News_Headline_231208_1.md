Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israeli forces have killed approximately half of Hamas' battalion commanders. However, he did not provide specific details or names of those killed. Israel's military released a photo showing 11 senior Hamas military leaders, claiming that five of them were killed. The photo was taken in a tunnel beneath Gaza, where Hamas was hiding. The Israeli incursion into Gaza has displaced over 90% of the population and led to a reported death toll of over 15,500 people. Israeli forces are now focusing on locating and eliminating top Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif. |

Canada's cybersecurity intelligence agency has issued a warning that foreign adversaries and hacktivists may use artificial intelligence (AI) to influence the country's upcoming federal election in 2025. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security states that cyber threat actors are increasingly utilizing generative AI to enhance online disinformation and that it is likely they will use this technology to influence voters. The report also highlights the potential use of deepfake videos to create false narratives and deceive voters. The agency cautions that as AI technology advances, it will become more challenging for social media platforms to detect and remove synthetic content before it reaches voters.
