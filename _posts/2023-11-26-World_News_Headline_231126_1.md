France has been ordered by the top administrative court to pay an additional €10 million in fines due to persistent air pollution in Paris and Lyon. Nitrogen dioxide levels in these cities remain above the European threshold, and current measures are unlikely to bring them down within a short period of time. The penalty consists of two fines of €5 million each, but it was reduced by half considering improvements in air quality in certain areas. Most of the fine will be allocated to government agencies working on climate change and air pollution. The court will review the government's actions again in the following year. |

According to royal expert Omid Scobie's new book, Prince William is already acting like he is the king, while his father, Prince Charles, is still trying to establish his own legacy. Scobie claims that William knows his father's reign is transitional and is behaving accordingly. The relationship between William and his brother, Prince Harry, has also been strained, with William allegedly using media and staff to smear Harry. Scobie disagrees with the notion of a united front against Harry and Meghan, stating that William has avoided talking to his brother altogether. |

A magnitude 5.4 earthquake struck off Taiwan's east coast, briefly shaking buildings in Taipei. There are no reports of damage or casualties. Taiwan is prone to earthquakes due to its location near the junction of two tectonic plates. The epicenter of the quake was in the sea off Taiwan's Hualien county at a depth of 22.4 km. This comes after previous deadly earthquakes in the region, with over 100 people killed in 2016 and more than 2,000 killed in 1999. |
