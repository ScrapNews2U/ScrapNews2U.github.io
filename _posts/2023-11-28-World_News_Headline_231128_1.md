Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis accused British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of cancelling a scheduled meeting in London due to a diplomatic dispute over the Parthenon Sculptures. Greece has been requesting the permanent return of these sculptures, which were removed by a British diplomat in the 19th century. The Greek government has been in talks with the British Museum regarding a possible loan deal, but Mitsotakis has expressed frustration that progress is not happening fast enough. The British government has stated that there are no plans to return the sculptures, as they were legally acquired. Instead, Deputy British Prime Minister Oliver Dowden is available for a meeting with Mitsotakis. The issue of the sculptures has been a source of dispute between Greece and Britain for centuries. |
