Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and California Governor Gavin Newsom will participate in a debate hosted by Sean Hannity on Fox News. The debate, dubbed a "slugfest," aims to highlight the differences between red and blue states. While DeSantis is a Republican presidential hopeful, Newsom is not running for the Democratic nomination in 2024. The debate poses political risks for both governors, particularly for DeSantis, who trails behind Donald Trump in the polls. The event is seen as an attempt to portray California as a liberal hellhole by the Fox News ecosystem. |
