Before taking out a loan for a two-wheeler, there are several crucial considerations to keep in mind. First, evaluate your affordability and budget to ensure that the loan fits comfortably within your financial situation. Next, thoroughly research and compare loan options from different lenders to find the best deal. Check your credit score and eligibility to improve your chances of approval and favorable interest rates. Choose a loan tenure and EMI that align with your financial goals. Understand the documentation and transparency of the loan agreement and factor in additional costs like insurance and maintenance. Finally, consider the impact of the loan on your future financial goals and ensure you can make the repayments without stress or default. |

Investors are being warned about the potential risks associated with small-cap stocks, which have seen a surge in valuations amid a recent rally in the market. With the possibility of further corrections and market turbulence, astute investors are reevaluating their portfolios and considering strategies to mitigate risks. One of these strategies is shifting allocations towards large-cap stocks, which are relatively more reasonably valued. Another approach is investing in mutual funds, specifically balanced advantage and multi-asset funds, which offer flexibility, diversification, and the potential for professional management. Multi-asset funds, in particular, can provide a hedge against geopolitical concerns by including an allocation to gold. |

Investors are increasingly putting money into small-cap funds, with net inflows in October reaching Rs 4,495 crore, up from the previous month's Rs 2,678 crore. However, experts say this does not necessarily mean investors are taking on more risk, as the majority of the money is invested through systematic investment plans (SIPs). Fund managers argue that small-cap funds provide a larger pool of companies to choose from and offer the potential for higher returns. It is emphasized that investors should have a long-term view and be aware of the risks associated with small-cap funds. |

The brokerage industry is facing challenges such as increased regulatory requirements and eroded profit margins. Without relief from fund-related compliance, many brokers could struggle to survive. However, there is potential for growth in the equity market, with opportunities to attract new customers through technology adoption. The financial industry can promote sustainability by maintaining a healthy CASA ratio and reducing non-performing assets. It should also embrace technology to streamline processes. Promising investment possibilities include the finance and manufacturing industries. Investors should be aware of trends related to alternative energy sources and environmentally-friendly technologies. |

According to Knight Frank India, Mumbai recorded a 30.0% YoY growth in property registrations during the festive season. The city registered 12,602 units between Navratri and Bhai Dooj, compared to 9,659 units registered during the same period last year. The state exchequer collected a total revenue of Rs 1,257 crore during this period. The surge in demand can be attributed to stable interest rates and homebuyers' desire for larger homes. Mumbai recorded a 37.4% YoY growth in property registrations during Navratri alone, with a total revenue of Rs 435 crore generated. The government collected over Rs 1,152 crore in stamp duty and other taxes during the festive season. |
