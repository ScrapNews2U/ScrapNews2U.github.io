The World Health Organization (WHO) has requested more information from China regarding a mysterious outbreak of influenza-like illness, particularly among children. Chinese hospitals have been overwhelmed with sick children showing symptoms of respiratory illness. Reports indicate that this spike in cases may be attributed to the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. The WHO is seeking additional information on known pathogens such as influenza and Covid-19, as well as the level of overcrowding in the health system. ProMed, a global surveillance system, issued an alert on the "undiagnosed pneumonia" in children. Hospitals in Beijing and Liaoning have seen an influx of sick children, suggesting that this is not an isolated local outbreak. Patients have high temperatures and pulmonary nodules but no symptoms or cough. The situation is being closely monitored to determine the cause and assess its severity. |

The vehicle was moving at a high rate of speed, crashed into the median, cleared a fence, and exploded. The bridge remains closed indefinitely, and nearby bridges have reopened. Prime Minister Trudeau and President Biden are monitoring the situation. The public was reassured about the latest information. Increased security measures are expected in New York City.
