The Lok Sabha ethics panel has adopted a report recommending the expulsion of Mahua Moitra from Lok Sabha in the ‘cash for query’ case. Despite this, the Trinamool Congress has appointed Moitra as the district president of Krishnanagar, the constituency she represents. The 500-page report alleges that Moitra shared her Parliament portal login credentials with a businessman, an act considered unethical. The report will be presented in the Lok Sabha on December 4th, and the government is expected to move a motion for her expulsion on the same day. Moitra, however, denies the allegations and claims there is a conspiracy against her involving Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Adani Group. |

Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has reshuffled his cabinet, sacking home secretary Suella Braverman and replacing her with James Cleverly. Braverman was removed from her position after making comments suggesting that homelessness is a "lifestyle choice." According to a report, this decision was not solely based on her recent clash with the prime minister over a Times article, but rather stemmed from her controversial remarks about homelessness. This reshuffle is seen as a move by Sunak to assert his strength and distance himself from potential political challenges. |
