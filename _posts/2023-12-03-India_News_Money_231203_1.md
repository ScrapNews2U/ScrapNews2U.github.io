Owning a home in India has become expensive, forcing many middle-class individuals to rely on home loans. In such cases, having a home loan insurance policy or a term insurance is essential to protect one's family from the burden of repayment in the event of their demise. Home loan insurance can be of two types - Term Insurance and Home Loan Protection Plan (HLPP). While both aim to cover the home loan, they have significant differences. Term insurance offers a fixed sum insured, while HLPP progressively reduces the sum insured as the loan is repaid. Additionally, term insurance is cheaper and offers benefits beyond the loan repayment. However, HLPP can cover health-related challenges and joblessness. Home loan insurance also becomes a risk mitigation factor for lenders. These insurance covers are affordable and easily accessible. It is advisable to consult a financial advisor to determine the best option for safeguarding one's family's future. |
