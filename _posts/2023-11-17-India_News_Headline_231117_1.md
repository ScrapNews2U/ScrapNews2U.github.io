Israeli soldiers have reportedly discovered a tunnel used by Hamas militants at Gaza's Al Shifa hospital, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims that a command center, bombs, and weapons were also uncovered. Hamas denies using the hospital for military purposes, calling the claims a "blatantly false narrative." President Joe Biden defended Israel's military operation at the hospital, stating that Hamas had headquartered their military operations underneath it. The United Nations expressed concern over the delivery of aid to Palestinians and the lack of communication and fuel supply in Gaza. Israeli officials also stated that some of the hostages taken in the October 7 attack were being held in the hospital complex. |
