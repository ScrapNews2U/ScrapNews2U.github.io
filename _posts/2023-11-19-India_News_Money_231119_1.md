Major economies such as the US, Euro zone, UK, China, and India have paused interest rate hikes and are now expected to cut rates next year. The US is likely to see rate cuts after July 2024, while the timing for other countries is uncertain. Central banks are considering the practicalities of higher interest rates, especially with the burden of debt. China has been cutting rates due to growth challenges and issues in the financial and real estate sectors. Lower interest rates benefit investment assets such as equity and fixed income. The primary driver for rate decisions is inflation.  |
