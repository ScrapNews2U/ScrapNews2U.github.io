The White House has accused Elon Musk of perpetuating an antisemitic lie on his social media site X. The accusation comes after Musk agreed with a post claiming that Jewish people harbor a "dialectical hatred" toward white people. In response, Apple and Disney have paused ads on X, and Tesla shareholders are calling for Musk's suspension. The White House called Musk's remarks unacceptable and highlighted the need to speak out against attacks on fellow Americans. Ads for major companies like IBM, Comcast, and Oracle have also been found running next to pro-Nazi content on X, leading to further backlash. The rise of antisemitic content on the platform has been a concern since Musk took over. The Anti-Defamation League reported a 900% increase in antisemitism on X following the Israel-Hamas conflict. |

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, has stated that after successfully eradicating Hamas, Israel will negotiate with Arab countries regarding the future governance of Gaza. Erdan mentioned that Israel is doing the "dirty work" for these Arab countries, as they also view Hamas as an enemy. He expressed opposition to an international force under the United Nations taking control of Gaza. Erdan blamed the United Nations for allowing Hamas to turn Gaza into a war and terror machine against Israel and called for an assessment of Israel's relations with the UN after the war. He also expressed appreciation for the support of U.S. President Joe Biden and Congress. The Israeli envoy emphasized the need to eradicate Hamas and free the hostages in Gaza, and mentioned the strong unity and support from U.S. Jewry during the "March for Israel" rally in Washington. Israel is determined to accomplish its goals and emerge stronger from this tragedy.  |

The new Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, has announced that more than 40,000 hours of security video from the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol will be released to the public. The footage, which has already been reviewed by a congressional committee, will be posted in batches on a public website to provide transparency and allow the American people to see what happened that day. The videos will blur the faces of private citizens and withhold sensitive security information. The House select committee has recommended charging former president Donald Trump with insurrection in connection with the Capitol riot. Over 1,200 people have been arrested in connection with the attack. |
