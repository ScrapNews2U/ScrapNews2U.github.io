Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hinted at a possible deal to free hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. He did not provide details, fearing that it would scuttle the plan. Netanyahu stated that less information would increase the chances of the plan materializing. The war between Israel and Hamas has claimed the lives of over 10,000 people, including children. Israel has been launching retaliatory assaults against Hamas after an attack that killed 1,400 people. The Israel Defense Forces delivered 300 liters of fuel to the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza, but Hamas declined the offer. The hospital is struggling to bury the remains of at least 100 people. In addition, attacks by Lebanon's Hezbollah group wounded seven Israeli troops and ten others. US President Joe Biden spoke to Qatar's Emir about efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas. Over 180,000 people in France marched against rising anti-Semitism in the wake of the ongoing war. |
