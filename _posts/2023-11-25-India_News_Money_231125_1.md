Delhi, the world's most polluted capital, continues to struggle with poor air quality despite government efforts. Construction bans and other measures have been implemented to combat pollution, but they have led to unemployment and economic challenges for the workforce. Public concern is lacking, as exemplified during Diwali night celebrations when bans on firecrackers were disregarded. The construction bans also have significant implications for the real estate sector, causing delays in housing unit deliveries and disrupting economic projections. India should learn from China's environmental strategies and adopt a collaborative approach involving citizens, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to find sustainable solutions to pollution. |

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has released an amendment to Rule 11UA, which outlines the procedures for evaluating investments in closely held companies. These amendments are crucial in determining whether Angel Tax will be applicable to start-ups. The new rule incorporates additional methods and benchmarks for determining the fair market value of unlisted equity shares. It also provides relief to investors and unlisted companies, including a 10% safe harbor limit and a requirement for the valuation report to be no older than 90 days. |

## Tax Liability on Auctioning Pledged Ornaments

Summary |

When a bank auctions pledged jewelry, there may be a long term capital gain (LTCG) that arises. The fair market value of the jewelry as of April 1, 2001 may be considered as the cost of acquisition for tax purposes. NRIs are not required to file an income tax return in India if they have not earned any income from India. Capital gains from the sale of a flat are calculated based on the date of transferring the property, not the date of booking the flat. Certain costs can be deducted from the sale consideration while calculating LTCG. Capital loss from derivatives trading cannot be set off against salary income. LTCG on the sale of mutual funds is taxed at 10% for periods longer than 12 months. Transferring shares to a relative does not trigger taxation, and the recipient can include the period for which the shares were held by the original owner and use the original cost of acquisition as their own. |

High net-worth individuals (HNIs) in India are increasingly purchasing substantial term insurance cover to protect themselves and their dependents. Customized policies are being offered by life insurers, tailored for wealth preservation and legacy security. Despite providing significant coverage, term insurance remains affordable, with monthly premiums ranging from Rs 3,000 to Rs 3500 for coverage amounts like Rs 5 crore. A study shows that HNIs accounted for 25% of the term insurance business in FY23, with the most preferred cover amount being Rs 1.75 crore. The introduction of tele-medical check-ups has also led to a surge in NRIs purchasing term insurance with considerable coverage. Coverage options up to Rs 20 crore are being offered to address the financial commitments and assets associated with HNIs. Overall, affordability, expansive coverage, and competitive offerings have made term insurance the preferred choice among HNIs. |
