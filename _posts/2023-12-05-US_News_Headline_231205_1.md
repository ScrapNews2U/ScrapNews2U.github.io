The US State Department's pilot program to renew H-1B visas will only be available for principal applicants, excluding their dependents. This decision may negatively impact H-1B professionals with families in the US. Business organizations and their members are calling for the inclusion of H-4 dependents in the program. However, the State Department cited technical and operational challenges as the reason for not including dependents in the pilot. Experts and officials believe that expanding the program to include dependents is crucial for its success. The program allows H-1B professionals to renew their visas without leaving the US. |
