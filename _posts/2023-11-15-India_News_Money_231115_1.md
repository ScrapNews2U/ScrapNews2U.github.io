Rent agreements, legally referred to as 'leave and license agreements', are essential for both homeowners and tenants to protect their rights. The agreement should include details such as the duration, renewal terms, lock-in period, rent charges, notice period, repair rights, dispute resolution, and termination conditions. It is typically for 11 months but can be negotiated. Homeowners should renew agreements after 11 months to avoid becoming tenants at sufferance. Rent increases can only occur with tenant consent. Notarized agreements have no legal sanctity; stamp duty payment and registration are required. Stamp duty varies by state. Homeowners should also consider police verification and pet registration as precautions. |
