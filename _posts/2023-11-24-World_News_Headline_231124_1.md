At least 96 people have been killed in Somalia due to intense flooding caused by the El Niño weather phenomenon. The floods have left thousands displaced and destroyed homes, roads, and bridges. Beledweyne, the most affected town, has seen the Shabelle River burst its banks, forcing 90% of the population to evacuate. The Somali federal government has declared a state of emergency and is appealing for international assistance. The flooding is expected to continue until December, with an estimated 1.6 million people at risk of being affected. Climate change is believed to be intensifying El Niño. |
