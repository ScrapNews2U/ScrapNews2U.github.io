Property-related disputes in India can be avoided by having a Will. A Will clearly outlines the distribution of assets and assigns liabilities after one's death, avoiding legal battles. When drafting a Will, one should declare personal details, identify all assets, appoint an executor, list beneficiaries with full names, addresses, and relationships, and have witnesses. It is important to review and update the Will periodically and ensure old versions are deleted or destroyed. Having a Will is crucial for securing the financial future and preserving wealth according to one's wishes. |

Investors are being advised to increase their allocation to large-cap funds as mid and small-cap stocks become less attractive. Large-cap stocks provide stability and diversification to a portfolio. The power of compounding also comes into play with large-cap companies, leading to substantial wealth creation. Experts suggest overweighting large-cap allocations and using systematic investment plans (SIPs) to invest in large-cap stocks. While mid and small-cap funds can still be considered, it is recommended to allocate a larger portion to large-cap investments initially and gradually increase exposure to mid and small-caps as knowledge and comfort with the market grows. The emergence of passive funds has led to outflows in large-cap funds, but multi-cap funds or flexi cap funds can be considered for better returns. Diversification across sectors is also important for consistency in large-cap funds. |
