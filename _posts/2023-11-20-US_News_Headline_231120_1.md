Donald Trump is returning to the US-Mexico border to promote a hard-line immigration agenda. He plans to terminate open-borders policies, revive the travel ban, implement "ideological screening," bar supporters of Hamas, deport immigrants with jihadist sympathies, invoke the Alien Enemies Act, end birthright citizenship, terminate work permits, build more border wall, crack down on legal asylum-seekers, shift federal law enforcement agents to immigration enforcement, and press Congress to pass a law imposing the death penalty on human traffickers. Trump's visit is expected to draw support from Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is also pushing for aggressive measures against migrants. Critics view Trump's proposals as extreme. Recent polling shows voter dissatisfaction with the Biden administration's handling of the border. |

The Supreme Court is set to tackle cases that could redefine the boundaries of gun ownership, signaling a critical moment for the court's conservative majority. The cases involve nonviolent crimes, domestic violence disputes, and drug use, and could potentially weaken other gun regulations. Gun rights groups predict that the court may limit the application of federal laws to "dangerous" individuals. The outcomes of these cases will have a significant impact on gun ownership and public safety in the United States. |
