Delhi's Anand Vihar neighborhood became the most polluted location in the city on Diwali due to the relentless bursting of firecrackers and police inaction in enforcing a ban. The PM 2.5 concentration at Anand Vihar reached 1,985 micrograms per cubic meter, which is 33 times the national safe standard and 132 times the safe-limit given by WHO. Other areas, including Patparganj and Jahangirpuri, also recorded extremely high PM 2.5 levels. The use of fireworks has taken Delhi back into a pollution crisis, and experts say that strong winds or rain are required to disperse the pollutants. |

UK prime minister Rishi Sunak has received his first no-confidence letter, criticizing him for ousting Boris Johnson and the reshuffling of his cabinet. MP Andrea Jenkyns states that it is time for Sunak to go and calls for the preservation of true Conservatism. A confidence vote would be triggered if 15% of MPs submit letters indicating a desire for a change in leadership. The reshuffle saw the return of former PM David Cameron and the replacement of several ministers. |

COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber highlighted India's commitment to multilateralism and global cooperation at a special forum of the G20 Presidency. He praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for leading countries representing 85% of the global economy to agree to COP28's goal of tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency by 2030. Jaber emphasized the need for a "new paradigm" in climate finance to ensure low carbon development and a fair global energy transition. He also called for the fulfillment of past pledges, such as the $100 billion climate financing for developing nations. Jaber's address followed the Fifth Meeting of the UNFCCC Transitional Committee on Loss and Damage, which agreed on operating the Loss and Damage fund at COP28. The success of COP28 will be determined by operationalizing the fund and setting an energy pathway to achieve the Paris Agreement's temperature goals. |

Akhilesh Yadav, the President of Samajwadi Party, mocked Rahul Gandhi's statement referring to the caste census as an 'X-ray' by suggesting the use of advanced technology like MRI and CT scans instead. He further claimed that a caste census could be completed in just three months as all the necessary data is available, including Aadhaar cards. The Congress party has been demanding a caste census, with Rahul Gandhi stating that it is crucial to frame policies for the welfare of Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The castes can be counted using the available data, according to Yadav. |

## Can BJP win back Karnataka by turning to Yediyurappa, Deve Gowda?

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Karnataka has appointed B Y Vijayendra, the son of veteran BJP leader B S Yediyurappa, as the new state president. This move is seen as an olive branch to Yediyurappa, who was removed as chief minister in 2021. The BJP hopes that by mending ties with Yediyurappa and forging an alliance with the Janata Dal (Secular), led by HD Deve Gowda, they can regain power in Karnataka. However, historical data suggests that sidelining Yediyurappa has led to poor performance for the BJP in the past. The JD(S) is also fighting an existential battle, with their worst performance in the 2023 elections. The alliance between these two influential social groups in Karnataka could trigger a counter-polarization in favor of the Congress. The outcome will be revealed in the 2024 Lok Sabha results. |
