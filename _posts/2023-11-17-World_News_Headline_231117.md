Israeli soldiers have discovered a tunnel shaft used by Hamas militants at Gaza's Al Shifa hospital, as well as a command centre with bombs and weapons, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamas has denied the claims, calling them "blatantly false." President Joe Biden has defended Israel's military operation at the hospital, stating that Hamas used it as a headquarters for military operations. The United Nations expressed concern about delivering aid to Palestinians in Gaza, as communication and fuel supplies are cut off. Israel's military campaign has resulted in civilian casualties, and Hamas is accused of holding hostages in the hospital complex. |

US President Joe Biden expressed his commitment to Asia-Pacific economies and emphasized the importance of stable US-China relations during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco. Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met for the first time in a year and pledged to avoid any dangerous rifts that could disrupt the global economy. They agreed to restore military-to-military links and address concerns about the production of fentanyl in China. Biden also highlighted the US commitment to the Pacific region and the need for continued engagement despite China's expanding influence. The summit will focus on issues like artificial intelligence, climate resilience, and supply chains. In addition, the US is striving to strengthen alliances with APEC countries worried about China's expansionist policies. A trade pact called the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) is central to this strategy, although it has faced obstacles due to domestic political opposition in the US. The summit will involve bilateral meetings, including those between Mexico and China. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will also meet with Biden to discuss issues such as fentanyl. Biden referred to Xi as a "dictator," but Xi received a warm reception at a dinner in San Francisco, where he hinted at using pandas as a symbol of friendship with the US. |

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that deliveries of artillery shells to Ukraine have decreased following the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Zelensky mentioned that the decrease in aid is not due to the US withholding support, but rather due to the heightened demand for armaments from various countries. Both Russia and Ukraine have struggled to maintain sufficient stockpiles of shells, and the European Union has faced challenges in providing arms supplies to Ukraine. Zelensky expressed appreciation for efforts in the United States to increase production. The territorial gains between Russia and Ukraine have remained stagnant for the past year, resulting in a stalemate.  |

Israeli officials state that around 240 people were taken hostage during the Hamas attacks, resulting in the deaths of 1,200 people, mostly civilians. The raid on Al-Shifa hospital by Israeli special forces has damaged the facility, with military equipment and footage relating to hostages allegedly found on computers.

Internet and telephone services have collapsed in the Gaza Strip due to a lack of fuel, cutting off communication for the 2.3 million people living there. This adds to the severe humanitarian crisis in the area, as aid efforts are hindered by the fuel shortages. Israel's offensive against Hamas continues, with a potential focus on the south of the territory. Israeli troops have searched Shifa Hospital for evidence of a Hamas command center, but have yet to find any. International pressure is growing on Israel to allow pauses in the fighting to provide aid. |
