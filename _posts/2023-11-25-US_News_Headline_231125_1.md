Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted of murdering George Floyd, was stabbed by another inmate at a federal prison in Arizona. Chauvin was seriously injured and hospitalized. The attack occurred at a medium-security prison that has been facing security and staffing issues. The Bureau of Prisons confirmed the incident and stated that the inmate was taken to the hospital for treatment. This is the second high-profile attack on a federal prisoner in recent months. Chauvin's lawyer had previously expressed concerns about his safety in prison. The Supreme Court recently rejected Chauvin's appeal of his murder conviction.

President Joe Biden expresses uncertainty regarding the release of American hostages by Hamas as part of a deal with Israel. Biden states that the US does not know when the release will occur and is unaware of the complete list of hostages. So far, no Americans have been released during the four-day truce in the Gaza Strip. Biden emphasizes his hope and expectation that the release will happen soon. The truce provides an opportunity for delivering essential resources to Gaza's civilians, but Biden criticizes Hamas for its disregard for the well-being of the people. Israel has indicated that the truce could be extended if Hamas releases more hostages daily. The US president reassures that efforts will continue to bring all the hostages home. However, protesters in Nantucket demand an end to the Israeli attack on Gaza. |

Vice President Kamala Harris faced controversy and criticism from conservatives after sharing a Thanksgiving photo featuring a gas stove. The presence of the gas stove in the background reignited concerns about the alleged plans of the Biden administration to ban such appliances. The speculation about a gas stove ban originated from an interview with a Biden-appointed U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) commissioner, but both CPSC officials clarified that there were no concrete plans to ban gas stoves. Despite this, conservative commentators continue to use the rumors as ammunition against the Biden administration. |

Skilled international workers on H-1B visas in the United States are turning to Canada for job opportunities after changes to the H-1B program created obstacles for highly skilled immigrant talent. Canada's H-1B visa program attracted a significant number of international applicants, closing within 48 hours of reaching the 10,000-application limit. Successful applicants in Canada will receive an open work permit for up to three years, allowing them to work for any employer across the country. The exodus to Canada reflects a need for reevaluating immigration policies in the US and abroad. |
