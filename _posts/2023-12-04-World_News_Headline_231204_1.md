Piers Morgan discloses the alleged names behind Archie's race remarks on his TalkTV show, in an effort to end the blackmail threat by Harry and Meghan. The names, revealed in a Dutch translation of a new book by Omid Scobie, accuse King Charles and Kate Middleton of expressing concerns about Archie's skin color. Morgan believes neither Charles nor Kate made racist comments and calls for transparency in order to prevent further damage caused by the allegation. The UK media is urging Harry and Meghan to deny the book's contents. King Charles is expected to respond soon. |
