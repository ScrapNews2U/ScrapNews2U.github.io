The BJP leader CT Ravi defended the respect accorded to the speakerâ€™s position and cautioned against diminishing its stature. While Zameer's office defended his remarks and highlighted the historic decision to appoint a Muslim speaker, the statement maintained that no insults were intended towards individuals or party legislators. Overall, the focus is on maintaining the dignity and stature of the speaker's role beyond divisive factors. |

Ashoka accused the Congress administration of planning to replace Savarkar's image with that of Jawaharlal Nehru. The BJP government had previously installed Savarkar's photo as he was a freedom fighter, but the Congress argues for Nehru's photo instead. Ashoka also criticized the Congress for promoting hereditary politics. The BJP vows to oppose the Congress government's communal measures and the imposition of Tipu Sultan's ideologies. |
