Shoppers are expressing anger on social media after claiming that Mucinex, an expectorant used for congestion, is disappearing from pharmacy shelves. This comes after the FDA announced that certain over-the-counter drugs, including those containing phenylephrine, were ineffective as nasal decongestants. While the FDA hasn't officially asked for their removal, many believe there is a conspiracy. One user clarified that it's not all cold medicine being removed, just those containing phenylephrine. They also noted that versions without phenylephrine, but with the effective pseudoephedrine, are still available. |
