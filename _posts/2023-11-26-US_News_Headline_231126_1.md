A show dog from Southern California diagnosed with a rare and deadly respiratory disease was saved by a powerful antibiotic called chloramphenicol. The disease, known as canine infectious respiratory disease complex, has been spreading among dogs in the US, with cases reported in multiple states. The antibiotic, considered a last resort, improved the dog's condition within hours, allowing him to regain his energy and be discharged from the hospital. The disease does not respond to standard treatments and its cause is still unknown. Dog owners are advised to keep their pets vaccinated and seek prompt vet care for respiratory symptoms. |

Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is serving a 21-year sentence for his involvement in the murder of George Floyd, was stabbed in prison. Prior to the attack, Chauvin tried to overturn his federal civil rights conviction by presenting theories from a forensic pathologist claiming that Floyd did not die from asphyxia but from a rare tumor. Chauvin alleges that his trial attorney failed to inform him about the pathologist and failed to challenge the constitutionality of the federal charge. |
