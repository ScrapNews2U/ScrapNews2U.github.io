Lawyer Jai Anant Dehadrai, referred to as Mahua Moitra's ex-friend, claims that ₹2 crore will be found, but not the furniture and Rolex, in relation to her alleged acceptance of the money from an industrialist for access to Parliament. The Lok Sabha Ethics Committee has completed its investigation and recommended Moitra's expulsion. Moitra, however, criticized the decision and vowed to return to the next Lok Sabha with a larger mandate. In response, she shared a news article about a BJP MP who was also accused of demanding ₹2 crore. Mahua Moitra and Jai Anant Dehadrai have had a history of conflict, including a custody battle over their pet. Dehadrai called Moitra a 'pathological liar' and questioned the origin of the questions that were sent to a 'mystery typist'. |

Rohit Sharma, captain of the Indian cricket team, is not worried about India's past record against New Zealand in World Cup matches. Despite New Zealand knocking India out of the previous edition and denying them another ICC trophy two years later, Rohit Sharma believes that the focus should be on the present and improving their performance. India is set to face New Zealand in the first semi-final of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 in Mumbai. While New Zealand has a history of defeating India in major ICC events, India has been in outstanding form in the tournament and appears to be the favorite heading into the match. |
