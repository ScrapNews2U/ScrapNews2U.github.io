Chief minister Ashok Gehlot is aiming for a sixth term as legislator in the upcoming assembly elections in Rajasthan. In the Sardarpura constituency, Gehlot's influence is clear as he has been the MLA five times and has won with increasing margins in each election. People in Sardarpura vote for the chief minister rather than their legislators. There is appreciation for Gehlot's schemes and development projects in Jodhpur, but the BJP is confident in putting up a serious challenge with their candidate Mahendra Singh Rathore. Rathore claims that the Gehlot government has failed to fulfill their promises and has engaged in corruption. Overall, the elections in Sardarpura will be a contest between Gehlot's clout and the BJP's challenge. |

The capital recently experienced its longest and most severe period of air pollution, with an AQI above 390 for eight consecutive days. Measures to control pollution will remain in place until a review on Monday. Experts anticipate an increase in respiratory illnesses post-Diwali and hospitals have prepared "pollution clinics" to handle the surge. |

The BJP blames the Congress-led state government for failing to control terrorism, while the Congress claims the attackers were BJP workers. Tags: Kanhaiya Lal, murder, hate crime |

The navy will also standardize uniforms for all officers and sailors. The new fire-retardant overalls aim to make women's work environment more comfortable and functional. This effort is part of the navy's goal to create an equal workplace for women. The navy is also redesignating ranks to make them gender neutral. |

Stakeholders in the Bollywood industry are adding clauses to talent contracts to safeguard themselves against the threat of deepfake technology. This comes after actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a deepfake video, prompting actor Amitabh Bachchan to call for legal and regulatory action. Actor Anil Kapoor has already been granted an injunction restraining entities from using his name and image for monetary gain using AI. Many actors are now incorporating specific language in their contracts to protect against malicious alteration of their images. There is a need for laws to govern the use of AI in this context. |
