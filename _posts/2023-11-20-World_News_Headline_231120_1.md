Argentina has elected right-wing libertarian Javier Milei as its new President, who promises economic shock therapy and plans to abolish the Central Bank of Argentina. Milei's win has shaken up the country's political landscape and is likely to impact trade with China and Brazil. He strongly opposes abortion and comprehensive sex education, supports civilian firearm ownership, and promotes the far-right cultural Marxism conspiracy theory. Despite this, Brazilian President Lula da Silva has extended his support to the newly elected government. |

Musk clarified that he wishes only the best for humanity and a prosperous future for all. The controversy started when Musk agreed with a video post calling out online hatred and rhetoric posted by individuals hiding behind internet anonymity.

Gaza's main hospital, Al-Shifa, is facing a dire situation, as Israel has ordered its immediate evacuation. A World Health Organization (WHO) team described the hospital as a "death zone" due to the presence of medical and solid waste, increasing the risk of infection for patients.
