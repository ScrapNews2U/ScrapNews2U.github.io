Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is optimistic about federal marijuana legalization in the near future, thanks to the SAFER Act. The act aims to reduce risks for cannabis businesses and provide access to banking services, which has been a challenge for the industry. Schumer highlights the growing public support for recreational cannabis, as seen in Ohio's recent vote legalizing marijuana. The SAFER Banking Act, previously approved by the Senate Banking Committee, could provide legal protection to banks working with cannabis retailers and allow financial institutions to offer more small business loans. Proponents argue that passing the act will enhance public safety and reduce burglaries in the cash-heavy cannabis industry. The bill would also address racial disparities in marijuana arrests, as black Americans are disproportionately targeted. However, the timing for securing the necessary Republican votes remains uncertain. |

14 U.S. states are experiencing a significant surge in coronavirus hospitalizations as winter approaches. The overall increase in the country is 8.6%, with higher spikes observed in the upper Midwest, parts of the South Atlantic, and southern Mountain regions. The rise is attributed to colder weather, which promotes increased virus transmission. Vermont leads with a 70% rise, followed by Iowa and Alaska at 60%. While some states may have startling increases, they represent a relatively low number of hospital admissions. This underscores the importance of remaining vigilant and adaptable in the face of shifting infection rates. |
