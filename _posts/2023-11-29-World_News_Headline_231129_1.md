Global leaders pay tribute to former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, praising his role in foreign affairs. However, on social media, Kissinger is widely criticized as a war criminal who caused lasting damage. Kissinger served as Secretary of State under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, having a significant impact on US foreign policy during the Vietnam War and the establishment of ties with China. While some acknowledge his accomplishments, others condemn his actions, particularly in Cambodia. Despite the mixed reactions, Kissinger's influence on global affairs is widely recognized. |

Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has stated that China is unlikely to consider a major invasion of Taiwan at this time due to its internal challenges. Tsai made these comments in response to questions about the risks of an invasion following the meeting between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Although tensions between the two leaders remain high regarding Taiwan, China is currently focused on domestic economic, financial, and political challenges. However, Beijing is still attempting to interfere in Taiwan's upcoming presidential election. Tsai emphasized the need for Taiwan to strengthen the resilience of its democracy instead of relying on Beijing's tactics. China considers Taiwan its territory and opposes any form of independence or external interference. The upcoming presidential election in Taiwan is being closely watched by both China and the United States. |
