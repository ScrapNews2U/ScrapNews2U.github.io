Small Cap Mutual Funds have shown impressive returns, outperforming mid-cap and large-cap funds this year. Investing in small-cap stocks can yield high returns and potentially turn small companies into big corporations. However, caution is warranted as small-cap stocks are highly sensitive to market sentiment and may experience higher volatility. Despite this, small-cap funds can be a good addition to an equity portfolio, especially for investors with a long-term view. Factors such as robust economic growth, healthy corporate earnings, emerging sectors, and high retail participation contribute to the potential of small-cap funds. |

In recent years, the Indian market has witnessed a shift in how companies reward their shareholders, with share buybacks becoming the preferred choice over traditional dividends. This transformation is driven by the tax advantages of buybacks, particularly for shareholders in the highest tax bracket. Buybacks have emerged as a tax-efficient way for these shareholders to maximize their post-tax returns. This trend is not limited to large-cap companies; small and mid-cap players are also leveraging buybacks to reward shareholders and minimize tax burdens. The tax treatment of buybacks versus dividends plays a crucial role in this shift, with buybacks subject to a lower tax rate. However, for individuals in lower tax brackets, dividends may still be the more beneficial option. |

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has directed banks and payment service providers to deactivate UPI IDs and numbers of customers who have not performed any transactions for one year or more. The move aims to ensure that funds are transferred only to intended recipients and to minimize the possibility of inadvertent fund transfers. Inactive UPI IDs will be disabled for inward credit transactions, meaning customers cannot receive funds. The NPCI has set a deadline of December 31 for deactivating UPI IDs of inactive customers. The measure is seen as a positive step towards enhancing the safety and efficiency of UPI payments. |
